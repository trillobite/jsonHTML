<!--
    This example produces similar html as what is in example.html, but quite possibly could be more difficult 
    to understand. One thing to notice here, is that this code is utilizing the more advanced features of jsonHTML,
    and is written in a more functional programming way. Notice how in order to manipulate the json objects in
    a more functional programming style, you have to call $jConstruct, as it will construct an object for you to
    easily manipulate with fascinating, and epic techniques. Of course, there is function chaining!
    
    To some, this style may be more practical as it may provide a better learning curve. Utilizing jsonHTML in this 
    way, does seem to open the doors to creativity and code reuse for future projects.
    
    Have Fun!
