                    'text-align': 'center',
                    'border': '1px solid black',
                    'border-radius': '5px',
                    'width': '300px',
                    'cursor': 'pointer',
                });

                //can append anywhere, even to the document body!
                main.appendTo('body');

                /*
                    See, that was not all that bad, was it? It should be quite simple,
                    and become more simple as you contine to work with jsonHTML.

                    Now, try out micronDB! Open your chrome console or firefox console,
                    and type this:

                    arrdb.query({
                        where: {
                            type: 'div',
                        }
                    });

                    If it returns an empty array, you probably need to click somewhere
                    within the document body, as the main element may still be a textbox.

                    If everything is correct, it will search for a jsonHTML object which
                    is set to be a DIV. It will return an array with a single element, 
                    which should be the main object which you see above in the code.

                    You can also call for a document directly if you have it's ID. When
                    you have the object's ID, it simply uses the standard math for hash
                    tables and brings your jsonHTML object back instantly, with no
                    searching. This is the command:

                    arrdb.get('exampleObjectID');  //go ahead and try it in your console!

                    Notice how with the get command, it returns a single object not 
                    contained in an array!
                */
            });
